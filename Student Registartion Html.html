#WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTML AND XHTML?
*What is HTML?
-HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language.
- It is used to create websites and web applications. 
 -Let’s break it down, so we understand the name better:
-Hypertext: Hypertext refers to the “text wrapped within a text.” It is very similar to hyperlinks and contains an underlying text that, when clicked, redirects to a new webpage.
-Markup language: A markup language is not necessarily a programming language. Instead, it is used to apply formatting and layout to a simple text document. This leads to more interactive and dynamic text content.
*HTML Versions
-November 24, 1995 HTML 2.0 was published as IETF RFC 1866.
-January 1997 HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group in September 1996.
-December 1997 HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
-april 1998 HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
-December 1999 HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
-It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0, and its last errata were published May 12, 2001.
-May 2000 ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 - Document description and processing languages).
-As of mid-2008, HTML 4.01 and ISO/IEC 15445:2000 are the most recent versions of HTML. Development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.
*What is XHTML?
-XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
-XHTML is almost similar to HTML but it is stricter than HTML
-It is swift, accurate, easily maintained, convertible, and formatted
-All major browsers support XHTML
-Also Read: The Best Guide to HTML Tags
*Versions of XHTML
-XHTML 1.0
-In earlier times[when?], Wikipedia used the XHTML 1.0 Transitional doctype and syntax, though it was not served as XHTML
-December 1998 saw the publication of a W3C Working Draft entitled Reformulating HTML in XML. This introduced Voyager, the codename for a new markup language based on HTML 4, but adhering to the stricter syntax rules of XML. By February 1999 the name of the specification had changed to XHTML 1.0: The Extensible HyperText Markup Language, and in January 2000 it was officially adopted as a W3C Recommendation.[46] There are three formal DTDs for XHTML 1.0, corresponding to the three different versions of HTML 4.01:
-XHTML 1.0 Strict is the XML equivalent to strict HTML 4.01, and includes elements and attributes that have not been marked deprecated in the HTML 4.01 specification. As of November 2015, XHTML 1.0 Strict is the document type used for the homepage of the website of the World Wide Web Consortium.
-XHTML 1.0 Transitional is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Transitional, and includes the presentational elements (such as center, font and strike) excluded from the strict version.
-XHTML 1.0 Frameset is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Frameset, and allows for the definition of frameset documents—a common Web feature in the late 1990s.
-The second edition of XHTML 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in August 2002
